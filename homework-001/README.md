# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This project was an On-The-Job Ticket/Feature Request Challenge in which the scenario required the HTML and CSS code to be cleaned up and organized. Many of the tags that divided up the source code was labled as div's which was albeit, functional, but not organized or effecient. I seperated each larger section into semantic tags for easier identification. This process really taught me the value of writing code neatly the first time. Not just for myself, but for the sake of future developers who will depend on me writing something that is easy to read and edit.
